# Explainable loan payment predictor
The goal of the project is to prepare machine learning models 
classifying whether the bank client is likely to pay of the loan.
While performance of the models in an important factor, the main
objective is to prepare an explainable solution, that would
increase the understanding and validity of the decision to the
client.
